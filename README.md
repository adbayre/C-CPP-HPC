# C / C++ / HPC Practice Repository

This repository contains mostly C and C++ programs created to practice programming skills. I also practice with MPI and OpenMP here. 
It also includes examples of core concepts such as control structures, functions, arrays, pointers, memory management, and object-oriented programming for reference.
